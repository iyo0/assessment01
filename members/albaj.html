    <p>My name is Jhan Criss Alba, and I am currently 20 years old. 
        I was born in Balanga City, Bataan. I grew up in the care of my Grandmother. 
        I also have 4 siblings, with me being the 2nd eldest. 
        My goal in life is to get a good-paying job and live a simple, happy life.</p>
    <p>I graduated from Cataning Elementary School. The place where I learned the basics and grew 
        the desire to achieve my goals. I then studied and graduated from Junior High School 
        at the City of Balanga National High School, where I met most of my friends that
         I’m still connected with to this day. I later transferred to Bataan National High
          School for my senior years and graduated there. This is also the place where I met 
          the people with whom I’ll be with in my college years.</p>
    <p>Spending those teenage years with my friends really helped in shaping who I am today. 
        It also helped me realize my goal in life. Especially during the senior high school 
        days, when the pandemic just ended, and face-to-face classes were just starting to be
         resumed. The lockdown had my desire to learn at its lowest as I thought there was 
         no really good reason to continue. That’s when I met my friends, who helped me 
         realize that it is still fun to learn and get achievements that will help you be 
         recognizable.</p>
    <p>I am now a 3rd year college student. Pursuing Information Technology at Bataan Peninsula 
        State University. I am currently finding it kinda hard to learn because of the lack of 
        face-to-face classes. Despite that setback, being able to learn new things for my future 
        career helps me to drive forward. Because there is no easy way to success.</p>
    <p>I am left with just 1 year until I graduate. The pressure is starting to hit me, 
        and it’s scary. But at the end of the day, as long as I did well and gave it my all.
         Eventually, it will pay off. As the saying goes, “You reap what you sow.”</p>
