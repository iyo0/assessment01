    <p>My name is Said Jr. B. Hussin, and I am 21 years old. 
        I was born in Balanga City, Bataan. I grew up in the care of my Grandmother. After my mom left for work.
        I have a younger sibling which is younger than me for only 10 months.
        My goal in life is to innovate and discover life along the road.</p>
    <p> I studied elemantary in Tenejero Elementary School now it is Tenejero Integrated School. 
        I then studied and graduated Junior High School in Bataan National High School.
        I then later studied Senior High School to Bataan National High School Senior High School. 
        In which I found my people that I'm going to be with probably until the end of my college years.</p>
    <p>Being with my closest friends during those adolescent years greatly shaped who I am now. 
        It also assisted me in achieving my life's goal and wakes my competitiveness within me. 
        Specifically in senior high school, when we just got back to the traditional class after 2 years of no face to face class. 
        My desire to learn was at its lowest during the lockdown since I didn't see any compelling reason to keep going. 
        At that point, I met my friends, who made me realize that learning new things and achieving goals that will make you recognizable are still enjoyable..</p>
    <p>I now being an Information Technology student after all these years I never thought I would be. 
        But It's not always easy to be an IT student, especially when it comes to demanding classes and assignments, but I try my best to be the best with every opportunity to get better. 
        I am very eager to learn more since I am confident that these abilities will be helpful in developing my future profession and in creating things for our fellow Filipino. 
        I'm making progress in expanding my knowledge and boosting my self-assurance.</p>
    <p>I go by the quote of "Arriving at the rock of accomplishment just to throw it more further". 
        It is a quote that there is more than your current accomplishment but that doesn't mean you will not enjoy it.
        ALways talk to yourself and make yourself your greatest friend and think positively.
        I know there is a lot for going but I will be glad to face that. God gave me power.
    </p>
