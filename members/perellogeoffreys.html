    <p>Hello, my name is Geoffrey S. Perello, and I am a college student at Bataan Peninsula State University. 
        I am taking up Information Technology, majoring in Networking and Web Application. As a college student my goal is to
        have fun and achieve the things I need for creating a great future for myself.</p>
    <p>Currently, I am living alone here in the Philippines. Both of my parents are living abroad because its such a long time that they were separeted because of my fathers work abroad,
        and my sister is also staying in Laguna for her work. Even though we are not always together, my family is always the staying close and connected to each other.
        My fathers sacrifices motivate me to be a good son and do the best I can to learn for me to repay what my parents do for me.
        Living on my own has taught me to be responsible to my actions, timely, and be indepent to sustain myself.</p>
    <p>As a person, I have interests that such as hobbies. I enjoy playing the guitar and singing because music keeps me calm and it helps me relax from the
        stressful school works. I also like biking for convinience of going to shop for my needs and excersice.</p>
    <p>Being an IT student is not always easy, especially with challenging subjects and projects, but I try tmy best to improve and be a great student.
        I am interested in learning more about web applications and website to broaden my knowledge and because I know these skills will 
        be useful in building my future career.</p>
    <p>Life is good and I love day dreaming about my future. I want to be a developer or have a stable financial income and stable self
        for myself and my future family. I believe that with the things Im doing right now, step by step I can reach my dreams.</p>
