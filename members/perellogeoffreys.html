    <p>Hello, my name is Geoffrey Perello, and I am currently a college student at Bataan Peninsula State University (BPSU). 
        I am taking up Information Technology, majoring in Networking and Web Application. As I continue my journey in college, 
        I am learning more about how technology connects people and systems, and this inspires me to work harder and stay focused 
        on my goals.</p>
    <p>I have learned to become independent because I am living alone. Both of my parents are working abroad, and my sister is also 
        staying in a far place. Even though we are not always together, my family remains an important part of my life. Their sacrifices 
        motivate me to do my best in school and in everything I do. Living on my own has taught me responsibility, patience, and how to 
        manage my time wisely.</p>
    <p>As a person, I have interests that keep me motivated and balanced. I enjoy playing the guitar and singing because music helps me 
        express myself and relax whenever I feel stressed. I also like biking, which gives me time to clear my mind, stay active, and enjoy 
        the outdoors. These hobbies help me stay positive and energized, especially during busy school days.</p>
    <p>Being an IT student is not always easy, especially with challenging subjects and projects, but I try to treat every difficulty as a 
        chance to improve. I am particularly interested in learning more about networks and web development because I know these skills will 
        be useful in building my future career. Step by step, I am working on improving my knowledge and becoming more confident in my abilities.</p>
    <p>Looking ahead, I have goals that I want to achieve in life. I want to finish my studies successfully and build a stable future for myself 
        and my family. I believe that with dedication, hard work, and a strong mindset, I can overcome challenges and reach my dreams. No matter 
        how difficult the journey becomes, I will keep pushing forward and continue improving myself.</p>
