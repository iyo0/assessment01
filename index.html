  Our group is named Cassiopeia, and we work together by assigning clear roles to each member.
  We believe teamwork is important because it helps us finish tasks faster and with better quality.
  Every member contributes based on their responsibilities, so the work becomes organized and balanced.
  We communicate regularly to avoid confusion and to make sure everyone understands what to do.
  Through cooperation and respect, we aim to submit a complete and well-prepared output for every activity.
